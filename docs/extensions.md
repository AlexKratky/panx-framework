# Extensions

Extensions can extend the panx-framework with new features, for example the PostManager. PostManager is one of official extension. PostManager includes templates files, css, classes etc. If you are asking, why PostManager is not the part of panx-framework by default, the answer is, that not every user will use it, so if you want to use it, you need install it additionally.

The extensions are ZIP files, so it will extract the zip files into panx-framework. Be carefully, that means some of your files can be overwritten, you should backup you project before installing extension.
